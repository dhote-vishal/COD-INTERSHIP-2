**Duration:** JULY 15th, 2024 to AUGUST 15th, 2024

**Mentor:** Muzammil Ahmed

## Overview of the Project

### Project: FINITE STATE MACHINE (FSM) DESIGN

### Objective

The objective of this task is to design Finite State Machines (FSMs) using Verilog or VHDL within a VLSI design environment. This includes the creation of FSM models that define various states and transitions. Additionally, the task involves writing comprehensive testbenches to rigorously test different states and transitions of the FSM.

### Key Activities

-**FSM Design in Verilog/VHDL**: Develop Finite State Machines using Verilog or VHDL, defining all states, transitions, and logic.

-**Testbench Development**: Write testbenches to cover various scenarios, including all possible states and transitions within the FSM.

-**Simulation Setup**: Configure the VLSI design environment to simulate the FSM, ensuring all testbenches are properly integrated.

-**Behavioral Simulation and Analysis**: Run simulations to observe and analyze the FSM's behavior, ensuring that all states and transitions function as intended.


### Technology Used

-**Verilog/VHDL**: Hardware description languages used for designing the Finite State Machines (FSMs).

-**Simulation Tools**: Tools such as ModelSim, Vivado, or Synopsys VCS for running simulations and verifying the behavior of the FSM.

-**VLSI Design Environments**: Software tools like Cadence, Synopsys, or Xilinx used for developing and simulating the FSM.


### Key Insights

1. *FSM Design Principles*:
   - Understanding the fundamental concepts of FSMs, including state transitions, state encoding, and the differences between Mealy and Moore machines.

2. *Importance of Testbenches*:
   - The critical role of well-constructed testbenches in verifying the correctness of FSM designs, ensuring that all possible states and transitions are thoroughly tested.

3. *Simulation and Debugging*:
   - The necessity of simulation in identifying and resolving design flaws, and the value of waveform analysis in diagnosing issues.
     
4. *Optimization Techniques*:
   - Techniques for optimizing FSM designs to reduce complexity, improve performance, and ensure efficient use of resources.
   

### Procedure

Step 1 : After login into Amazon AWS, Visit the EC2 instance 


Step 2 : Then we will directed to the another webpage, then we will click here to launch instance, then we will proceed to next step 
where, we will fill all required info about Name, AMI etc, we will have the new instance live after few seconds.


Step 3 : Then we will click in Required Instance, then click on connect for further proceed. As we click, we will have console.



Step 4 : In console, we will run various cmd for updation, upload github wepage link, uploading webpages file.



Step 5 : Then, by Selecting the instance , gone to Security Groups & in inbound rules, we will change it to https & https, for public accessible all over the internet.



Step 6 : Then, we will seen that our webpage got live, while accessing through the public ip address
